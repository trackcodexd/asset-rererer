# Contributing

Thank you for being interested in contributing. I'm always trying to improve myself and whatever I put out. But, I'm just a 1 person team, so there is only so much I can do. I can always use the help from the community.

## Questions

If you have any questions join the [discord](https://discord.gg/XTEtUqPTat) or shoot me a DM, my tag is alekfart.

## Bug reports and suggestions

Reporting bugs and telling me how to make the reuploader better is also a big role in contributing. Community feedback means a lot, and I do TRY to listen to you guys. There is a dedicated suggestion channel in the discord so please suggest there. If you have a bug report then feel free to complain in general, DM me, or [create a new issue](https://github.com/kartFr/Asset-Reuploader/issues).

## Code

If you are thinking about contributing to the code, CONGRATULATIONS! You are probably a better coder than 99% of the people in the discord...

But really, code contributions are welcome and I'm always looking to improve my code and it's a great way for you to contribute to your community. So don't be afraid. Code contributors also get permanent access to the early access for the reuploader. Unless it is miniscule like fixing grammar, But it is up to my discretion.

ALL forks are welcome!!

## Requirements

There are requirements when developing locally.

### Plugin

1. **[Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman)**, a tool chain manager.

Plugin is edited with **[PluginDebugService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/plugins)** on, so make sure to turn that on if you are planning to edit the plugin.

### Reuploader

1. **[Go](https://go.dev/)**

## Thank you

I'm only one guy. Contributions from the community is the only way this project has became this good. Everything major from code to minor like a bug report, I appreciate you all. Without contributors and support from the community this project would be nowhere near how it is now.
